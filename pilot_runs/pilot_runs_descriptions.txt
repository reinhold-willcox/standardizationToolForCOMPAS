basic: 
Turn off rotation completely
There may be spin up from accretion to watch for
In COSMIC, spins are fixed to zero in each step
single stellar winds - as in MIST
wind accretion off — BSE implement**
AML exchange/binary orbit effects from winds off
tides off
no MB — COSMIC implement**, BSE implement**
Hurley qcrits, Hjellming & Webbink — COMPAS implement**, BSE implement?**
Hurley+2002 donor mass loss — COMPAS implement**
thermal limit for mass accretion
jeans mode mass loss for non-accreted RLO — BSE implement?**
alpha-lambda; alpha=1, lambda=Pols fits from Claeys+2014 → Note, Claeys+2014 may differ from the BSE implementation -> stick to BSE here
Set lambda_ion parameter to zero
Initial eccentricity = 0, Z=0.02, 

basic1b: 
Same as above, but turn on spins and tides
Spirit here is to see uncertainties from spins
We want to be able to track where angular momentum goes, how mass is lost, etc
Need to fix the initial spins of the stars
There is a definition in Hurley
– SeBa included if: tides off, MB off, qcrits, Hurley donor mass loss

intermediate: 
Bondi-Hoyle winds (wind speed beta = 0.125, alpha=0.8)
AML exchange/binary orbit effects from winds off
tides (Hurley+2002) — (SeBa - based on it’s own prescription)
MB Rappaport + 1983 — COMPAS implement**?
Zetas (choose these) — COSMIC implement**, SEVN implement**
timescale-based donor mass loss — COSMIC implement**, SEVN implement**
thermal limit for mass accretion
jeans mode mass loss for non-accreted RLO — BSE implement?**
alpha-lambda; alpha=1, lambda=Pols fits from Claeys+2014 — SeBa implement? 
Decide on lambda_ion parameter
